Single cell suspensions of colonic biopsies from eight patients were stained with antibodies and sorted by FACS. 
Single cell 5’ gene expression 
libraries were prepared for CD45+CD3+CD19- (HB1), CD45+CD3-CD19+ (HB2), CD45+CD3-CD19- (HB3-1) and CD45- (HB4) 
cells obtained from pooled cells 
of 4 patients. 
Single cell 5’ gene expression library was prepared for CD45+CD3-CD19- (HB3-2) cells from pooled 
cells of 2 patients. 
Single cell 3’ gene expression libraries were prepared for CD45+ (S279 and S280) cells obtained from 2 
patients respectively.
